## NASA Lunar Autonomy Challenge IPEx Code
Code for the simulated NASA ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEx) rover to achieve the objectives of the 2025 NASA Lunar Autonomy Challenge. Due to the conclusion of the competition, this project currently serves as an excellent simulated robotic testbed for the exploration of new algorithms and software systems.

### Challenge Description
The NASA Lunar Autonomy Challenge was a competition to develop a fully autonomous agent to map and navigate an unknown lunar environment. The challenge emulates NASA priorities in robotic exploration as we explore the lunar south pole in the Artemis missions. The agent is judged by its capacity to generate a geometric map of ground height, rock map, mapping productivity, and localization abilities in the partially occluded visual conditions. The challenge website can be found here.
